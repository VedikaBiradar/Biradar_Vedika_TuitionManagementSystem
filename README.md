                                      ####Tuition Management System ####
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive tuition management system tailored for educational institutions.
This system is designed to enhance the efficiency of administrative tasks, streamline the management of student and parent data, track fees, and 
facilitate seamless communication between students, parents, and staff or teachers. Additionally, it will provide tools for monitoring student progress and educational activities.

##Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of how my application works from a technical perspective:

Spring Boot Framework: Acts as the backbone of the application, providing a robust and scalable structure. It simplifies development with its auto-configuration and embedded server capabilities.

Java: The primary programming language used to implement business logic, data handling, and application functionality.

Thymeleaf: Used as the server-side template engine to generate dynamic HTML content. It integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot to render views.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Form the front-end of the application, providing the structure, styling, and interactivity of web pages.

Spring Security: Adds a layer of security to the application by handling authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain parts of the system.

Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code by automatically generating getters, setters, and other commonly used methods, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

Database Integration: Utilizes Spring Data JPA to manage database operations, providing a seamless way to interact with the database using repositories.

Controller Layer: Manages incoming HTTP requests, processes them with business logic, and returns responses. It integrates with Thymeleaf templates to render dynamic content.

Service Layer: Contains business logic and service methods that interact with the data layer and provide the necessary functionality for the application.

Repository Layer: Utilizes Spring Data JPA to handle data persistence and retrieval, abstracting the complexities of database interactions.

Security Configuration: Customizes Spring Security settings to define user roles, permissions, and access controls.

Dynamic Content: Uses Thymeleaf to dynamically generate HTML content based on user interactions and data from the back-end.
